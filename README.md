### POWRPLNT aims to provide a space where the digital arts community may interact with the next generation of creators. 

It functions as both a gallery space and a think tank, an environment where people from all backgrounds may learn the skills necessary to express themselves creatively in todayâ€™s networks.

Empowerment is central to our mission. By providing people with the resources to learn new digital languages for expressing their ideas, we are designing futures, encouraging conversation and inspiring new works on all levels of cultural engagement. We see the digital divide as a social justice issue, POWRPLNT is an important initiative for inspiring more people of color from underserved areas to produce the future they wish too see. 

1. POWRPLNT engages youth with free Interest-driven courses, introducing the tools of digital art production. We also provide donation based classes for adults. 
2. POWRPLNT is an indoor garden creating a union between the digital world and an urban green space. 
3. POWRPLNT operates as a free computer workspace or Internet Lounge when classes are not in session.
